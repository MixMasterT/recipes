Ingredients:
-2 cups flower
-1 1/2 cups milk
-1 egg
-1/3 cup 
-1/4 cup sugar
-1/2 tsp salt
-(optional) blueberries and or bananas


Directions:
1. Mix flour, sugar, and salt in large bowl
2. In separate bowl, mix milk, and egg. Beat until light, but do not over beat.
3. Add wet ingredients into dry mix. Mix well and break up lumps.
4. Add water if mix appears too dry.
5. Heat frying pan, or skillet, and add butter or oil to avoid sticking.
6. Use mug or ladel to drop blobs of batter onto frying surface.
(if using optional fruit, add to blobs by hand, or mix into batter.)
7. Flip after bubbles appear. Then finish for approximately 2/3 of the time of first flip (judge by color:
too white means surface isn't hot enough or you flipped too fast, too dark means too hot, or you flipped too slow...).
8. Add butter, syrup and serve.
